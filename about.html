                        <p>Charles Hoskinson is a mathematician, founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, which are two of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency networks.
                        He attended Metropolitan State University of Denver and University of Colorado Boulder to study analytic number theory before moving into blockchain. Hoskinson joined the Ethereum founding team with Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and left in June 2014. He devoted a lot of time to the Ethereum project because he realized it was "going to be big”.
                        After having returned to study mathematics, he was then approached by former Ethereum colleague Jeremy Wood to form a new project called IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), an engineering and research company that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains. IOHK's key project is Cardano, a public blockchain and smart-contract platform that hosts the Ada cryptocurrency.In 2017, Hoskinson and IOHK sponsored research labs focusing on blockchain technology at the University of Edinburgh and the Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 2020, Hoskinson opened a blockchain research project at the University of Wyoming.</p>

                        <p>The Cardano Foundation is an independent standards body that oversees and supervises the advancement of Cardano and the Cardano ecosystem. As the legal custodian of the protocol and the owner of the Cardano brand, the Foundation works to drive adoption and partnerships, grow the Cardano community globally, shape legislation and commercial standards, and ensure stakeholder accountability at every level.
                            The Foundation’s most crucial responsibility is driving platform adoption and supporting the diverse Cardano community – people like you – engaging with and implementing ideas on the Cardano platform. To fulfil this caretaking role to the highest standards, the Cardano Foundation has a governing Council, a professional executive team and community managers, recruited in many cases directly from the wider Cardano community.
                            However, their focus is as outward-looking as it is inward. The Foundation is equally committed to working with other key industries within the blockchain realm, contributing to the advancement of the technology and driving adoption with other compatible systems. The Foundation contributes to the conversation and perception of blockchain globally, focusing on legal frameworks, integration with legacy systems and third-parties, awareness, and education – to ensure that blockchain technology can be accessed and understood by all.</p>
