## UX

What users should get from this site is a better understanding of Cardano how it works, the people, how to store their ADA, the companies behind it and what it is trying to acheive within its roadmap. I have found that the information for Cardano is scatter across the web with no site that brings it all together. This should solve that problem for people intreseted in Cardano and who want to get started with it.
