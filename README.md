## UX

What users should get from this site is a better understanding of Cardano how it works, the people, how to store their ADA, the companies behind it and what it is trying to acheive within its roadmap. I have found that the information for Cardano is scatter across the web with no site that brings it all together. This should solve that problem for people intreseted in Cardano and who want to get started with it.

## Additional Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, samsung.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### UX on mobile 
- Simple changes were needed to be made for mobile users so that the information was more appealing on a mobile device. e.g removing the profile pictures from the quotes on the landing page. While testing I found that I had to edit the image I used for the quote section as the white writing got lost in the image. 

### Landing page 

- On a desktop, when hovering over the pictures on the landing page I found the writing dropdown was too slow for users to see in time and then changed the timing from 1sec to 0.5 sec.

### Contact form 

- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
